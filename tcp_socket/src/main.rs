/**
* The goal of this project is to build a basic implementation of
* the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) as specified in RFC 793 (https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc793)
*
* For the implementation I followed along with Jon Gjengset's YouTube playlist
* of him doing the same (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzja9fQWzdA&list=PLqbS7AVVErFivDY3iKAQk3_VAm8SXwt1X)
*
* My hope is to gain a better understanding of how the protocol works while also getting a better
* understand of the Rust language.
